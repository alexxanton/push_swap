## Description
This project teaches how to develop and optimize a complex logic using a limited set of instructions.
A sorting algorithm has to be implemented and managed meticulosly with the following instructions:

## Instructions
Clone the repository and compile the project:
```
git clone <repository> push_swap
cd push_swap
make
```
To execute the program:
```
./push_swap <numbers>
```
And to check if the program sorts the numbers:
```
./push_swap <numbers> | ./checker_<OS> <numbers>
```
You will see OK if the program sorts the numbers and KO if it doesn't.
